  // "Modern" and "Diagnostics Toolkit" were spending 30 of the ~60 characters

  // differentiator, and MCP is the one term here with real intent behind it
  // and almost no competition.
  title: 'NetsCLI — Network Scanner for Desktop, CLI, and MCP',
  // 153 characters. The previous one ran to 172 and was cut around 158, which
  // truncated the MCP mention off the end -- the most valuable word in it. It
  // also ran operations and interfaces through a single "for" series
  // ("a scanner for ... packet capture, and desktop, terminal, CLI, and MCP
  // workflows"), which does not parse cleanly.
  // "inspect hosts", not "trace routes": the sentence attributes what it
  // lists to all four interfaces, and the MCP server has no traceroute tool.
  // `inspect_host` is a real MCP tool, so the swap keeps the claim true.
  // Measured at 154 characters in the built page, one more than the 153 this
  // replaced -- still inside the ~160 a search result shows, and the MCP
  // mention this description was rewritten to protect is nowhere near the cut.

  // Same scoping as the hero subhead: capture is not in any published desktop
  // installer, so this must not imply it ships with the app. It is what search
  // results and link previews show, which is where an inaccurate claim travels
  // furthest.
