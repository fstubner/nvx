title: Interface coverage
description: What NetsCLI exposes in the desktop app, CLI, TUI, MCP server, and packet-capture builds.
---

NetsCLI has one Rust core library and several interfaces. Shared network behavior belongs in the core; each interface exposes the parts that fit its job.

## Desktop app

The desktop app focuses on interactive network work: tabs, filtering, row selection, details, history, exports, and local status indicators.

It exposes shared operations where a table or details pane improves the workflow. Shell maintenance workflows such as setup, doctor, completions, manpages, and MCP service management stay in the CLI.

## CLI

The CLI exposes shared network operations plus command-line maintenance workflows:

- Structured output through `--json` and `--yaml`.
- Setup and dependency checks.
- MCP server launch and service management where supported.
- Shell completions and manpage generation.

## TUI

The terminal UI is for keyboard-driven interactive work inside a terminal. It stays close to the CLI operation model while favoring readable summaries and terminal-native navigation. It can export the current session as Markdown or JSON with `/export`.

## MCP server

The MCP server exposes shared network operations to AI-agent clients. It does not define desktop UI behavior, and desktop app actions do not depend on MCP service-management code.

## Build and runtime availability

Most NetsCLI operations work in the standard published builds. A few capabilities depend on how the app was packaged or what is installed on the machine:

- Packet Capture appears only in builds that include packet-capture support. Capturing packets also needs Npcap on Windows or libpcap on Linux/macOS.
- mDNS discovery is included in the published CLI, desktop app, and MCP server. Library consumers can still build `netscli-core` without the `mdns` feature if they need a leaner dependency set.
- The desktop app hides tools that are not available in the current build.
- If a runtime dependency is missing, NetsCLI keeps the rest of the app usable and explains what to install for that feature.
