## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
* **Multi-Platform Swapping**: Zero-dependency swapping of Node.js versions in under a millisecond by modifying only session-level shell environment variables (`PATH`, `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX`), supporting PowerShell, Zsh, and Bash.
* **Auto-Configuration Swapping**: Instantly switches Node.js version when navigating into directories containing configuration files (`.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `package.json`, or Volta configurations).
* **Dynamic PATH Shim Architecture**: Uses dynamic shims in `~/.nvx/bin` to intercept execution reliably in subshells, IDEs, and scripts, resolving early shell alias vulnerabilities.
* **Registry Checksum Integrity**: Enforces cryptographic integrity for Node.js downloads using SHA-256 hashes from nodejs.org, mitigating MITM or server compromise attacks.
* **Interactive Security Interceptor**: Intercepts `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` install commands to perform:
  * Vulnerability scans against the OSV database.
  * Typosquatting audits based on Levenshtein distance and registry download comparison.
  * Release-age warning for packages published less than 24 hours ago.
  * Install script blocking/warning to prevent arbitrary code execution during dependencies installation.
* **Flexible Process Sandboxing**: Runs executions inside isolated environments across platforms: using OS-native isolation (Windows Low Integrity Levels and Linux Namespaces with environment scrubbing/home folder virtualization), containerized via Docker, or natively via Windows Subsystem for Linux Containers (`wslc`), macOS native sandboxing (`sandbox-exec`), or Linux container runtimes (`systemd-nspawn`).
* **CI Integration**: Added remote GitHub Actions CI pipeline testing across Windows, macOS, and Linux matrix with `gosec` and `govulncheck` static analysis scanners.
