# Shared helpers for the publish-*.sh scripts.
#
# Source this, don't execute it:
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/lib.sh"
#
# Ported from netscli's scripts/release/lib.sh, where one implementation
# shared by every publish script is what stopped the same handful of bugs
# being copy-pasted per registry. The same reasoning applies here even at
# two scripts, because the third caller is publish.yml itself.

# --- Tag validation ------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every publish script interpolates the tag into shell strings, sed
# replacements, and commit messages. `workflow_dispatch` lets a caller
# supply an arbitrary tag input, so validate before it reaches any of
# those. Accepts `v1.2.3` and `v1.2.3-rc.1`, rejects everything else,
# including anything containing shell metacharacters.

    echo "ERROR: refusing to publish malformed tag: '${tag}'" >&2
    echo "       expected vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]" >&2
    return 1
  fi
}

# --- Asset availability --------------------------------------------------
#
# release.yml builds on the tag push and publishes a DRAFT, so by the time
# `release: published` fires the assets are normally already attached. The
# poll is for the other two ways in. A `workflow_dispatch` re-run can be
# aimed at a tag whose release.yml run is still building, and release.yml
# waits on CI before it builds anything, which puts twenty minutes between
# the tag and the first uploaded byte. Poll for up to 15 minutes rather
# than failing instantly on an asset that is merely late.
#
# Progress goes to stderr, deliberately. `verified_sha` calls this, and every
# caller of `verified_sha` uses a command substitution, so anything written
# to stdout here is captured as part of the checksum. That is not
# hypothetical. In netscli, with the retry engaged, `sha` became
#
#   "  not yet; retry in 30s (1/30)\n<the real digest>"
#
# which the downstream patch wrote into the formula, and the render check
# then rejected with "expected 4 valid sha256 lines, got 0". The error named
# the manifest rather than the cause. `lib_test.sh` pins it.
wait_for_asset() {

  echo "ERROR: $url never became available" >&2
  return 1
}

# --- Checksum verification -----------------------------------------------
#
# Print the SHA256 for an asset, having actually verified it.
#
# Reading the `.sha256` sidecar and trusting it is circular. The sidecar and
# the asset come from the same origin, so a bad sidecar produces a bad
# manifest and nothing notices. It also accepts an empty value, because the
# downstream `grep -c 'sha256 "'` guards match `sha256 ""` happily, so a
# truncated sidecar could publish a formula with blank hashes.
#
# Instead: fetch the sidecar, fetch the asset, hash the asset locally, and
# require all three of (sidecar is 64 hex chars), (local hash is 64 hex
# chars), (they match). Any failure aborts the publish.
#
# Usage: sha=$(verified_sha "$BASE" "nvx-linux-amd64")

# --- Repo checkout -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Clone without putting GH_TOKEN in the remote URL. A token in the URL is
# written to .git/config and can surface in git's error output on a
# failed push. `http.extraheader` keeps it in the config as a header
# value that git redacts.

# --- Commit and push -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Idempotent. Re-running a publish for the same tag is the recovery path
# publish.yml's header offers, and `git commit` exits non-zero with nothing
# staged, which `set -e` would turn into a failure. Retries the push so a concurrent
# sibling job racing on the same repo doesn't lose the update. The tap and
# the bucket each hold manifests for more than one project, so that race is
# real rather than theoretical.
