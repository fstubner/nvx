# These exist because of a specific incident in netscli, the project these
# scripts are ported from. `wait_for_asset` printed its retry progress to
# stdout, `verified_sha` calls it, and every caller does
# `sha=$(verified_sha ...)`, so the progress lines were captured as part of
# the checksum and written into the Homebrew and Scoop manifests. Every
# publish job failed, with an error naming the manifest rather than the
# cause.
#
# Nothing in shellcheck catches that, and the publish path only runs during
# a release, so a silent reintroduction would not surface until the next one.

# Run: bash scripts/release/lib_test.sh
